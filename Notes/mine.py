# interpreter ??
# language translator
# translate the code if it founds an error gives an error message if the
# program is correct gives an output
#
# it is an cross-platform language
# mac.linux,uniux,windows
# it has largest libraries:
# many third-party libraries and frameworks can be used here


# Literals:
# A literals means it will give us the exact datatype value stored in an identifier

# Builtins:
# predefined/implicit/inbuild those are all builtin functions
# must be enclosed with () parenthesis
# it is an short way to render the output


# types of operators:
# 1. Arithmetic operator +,-,*,/,%,//
# 2. Assignment operator <,>,<=,>=
# 3. Comparison operator/relation operator #and,or, not
# 4. Membership operator in  not in
# 5. identity operator is,is not
# 6. logical operator +=,-=,/=,*=,//=


#break - (while you need to print the value until if the condition is true so you can skip the other values)
#it is used to terminate the loop execution and comes out of the loop when certain test condition is met
#and fullfilled.

#continue - it is usually checks the given statement instead of terminating the loop execution,
#this statement pause the loop execution and comes out of the loop then prints the remain program
#execution from next element of the ongoing loop iteration and then resumes the loop execution.


#class

#a class is the internal datamodel references of itself
#it is a prototype to creating an object
#user defined structure to create an object
#prototype which allow creating new object with data model
#otherwise we can say class is a collection of
#1. states and behaviour
#2. data and function
#3. variables and members
#4. data variable and member function
#5. properties and methods

#self keyword is the first parameter among the rest of the parameter
#it is not possible to give value to self keyword directly during program execution interpreter will pass the values
#self keyword is used to represent the instance of the class(object)
#self keyword is used to bind the attributes with the given arguments
#instead of self we can pass any name to it
#it is used in method definition and variable declaration
#self = to access the current object we use self keyword

#constructors:
#1. Constructor is a special method
#2. The name constructor is always ___init__()
#3. we are not required to call constructor explicitly.it will be executed
#4. it will be executed automatically when we create an object
#5. per object constructor will be executed only once
#6. main purpose of constructor is to declare and initialize instance variable
#7. __init__means initialization
#8. self refers to current object
#9. constructor should take one argument(self)to refer current object


#Inheritance
#inheritance means the process of achieveing and accessing the functions and attributes of the base class
#from its different derived class is called inheritance

#single inheritance
#if a child class is inheriting the properties and attributes of a single parent class is called as single inheritance.

#multiple inheritance
#if a child class inherits the properties and behaviour of more than one class is called multiple inheritance.

#multilevel inheritance
#if a child class will become a super class for another child class is called multi level inheritance.

#hierarchical inheritance
#if multiple inheritance occurs within same child class base class is called as hierarchical inheritance

'''
Method:
    1. method name can be anything
    2. methods wont be executed automatically,we have to call explicitly.
    3. per object we can call method any no of times.
    4. we can write business logic based on our programming requirement.

constructor:
    1. means name should be _init_
    2. constructors will be called automatically whenever we are creating a object
    3. per object constructor will be executed only once.
    4. Inside const we have to write a code to declare and initialize.
'''

'''
in inheritance all members available in parent class are the default values in the child class,
if the child class does not satisfy with the parent class implementation, then the child classs
is allowed to redefine the method by extending additional function in the child class is said to
be an method override that is when the child class method has same name same parameter and same
return type(function) then that method in the class is said to be override the method in the
parent class.
